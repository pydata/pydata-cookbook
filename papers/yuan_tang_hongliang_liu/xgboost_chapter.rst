XGBoost: A Portable Distributed Gradient Boosting Library

------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   XGBoost is a distributed machine learning library under gradient boosting framework. It is designed and optimized for high efficiency, flexibility and portability. It provides a parallel tree boosting implementation (also known as GBDT or GBM) for solving many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. Beyond single machine parallelization, XGBoost also runs on major distributed environment such as Hadoop/YARN, Spark, and Flink, for distributed model training. More than half of the winning solutions in machine learning challenges hosted at Kaggle adopt XGBoost, and a wide range of use cases across industries. In this chapter, we will briefly introduce XGBoost, explain the meanings of selected important parameters, and the techniques for optimizing prediction using Python.
