    "Python has dozens of plotting libraries, and there is usually a good solution for any data-visualization need.  However, it can be very difficult for users to determine which library is best for a given task, let alone learning how to use each library or how to combine them to solve problems. This chapter will introduce PyViz, a collaborative effort from the authors of HoloViews, GeoViews, Bokeh, Datashader, and Param to provide a comprehensive, easy to learn and use solution for:\n",

    "- Deploying live Python-backed visual applications\n",

    "* [**XArray**](http://xarray): Labeled multidimensional arrays\n",
    "* [**Pandas**](http://pandas.pydata.org): Columnar datasets (tables)\n",
    "* [**Dask**](http://dask.pydata.org): Multidimensional arrays and columnar data processed in chunks for out-of-core or distributed computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have such data, it is *possible* to plot it using a Python plotting/visualization library directly:\n",

    "\n",
    "These libraries allow Python programmers to make web-based or publication-ready visualizations, for large and small data and in a geographic context if appropriate. However, getting good results from them in all but the simplest cases generally requires a level of programming expertise, code development, and time investment that is out of reach for casual Python users and analysts, and distracting even for experts, if they mainly want to focus on their data.  Moreover, applying these tools alone or in combination to a series of typical data-exploration problems generally leads to large body of custom, problem-specific code that is difficult to maintain and to adapt to new applications.\n",

    "* [**Param**](https://github.com/ioam/param): Declaring user-relevant parameters that can (later) be used to create custom widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "HoloViews and GeoViews provide the power of the underlying Bokeh, Datashader, Matplotlib, and Cartopy libraries, but with a data-centric API that makes their power more readily available and easier to use for people whose main focus is not on programming but on data exploration and communication. Param is an underlying technology used by HoloViews and GeoViews, but it also makes it simple for end users to declare custom parameters that can be used to control their visualizations using widgets in notebooks and deployed apps, or programmatically for parameter sweeps or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this chapter, we will show you how to use HoloViews, GeoViews, and Param to work naturally with your data over the entire process from initial discovery and exploration to sharing it via publications, presentations, demonstrations, and interactive applications. At each stage, the data will be instantly visualizable when working with it in a notebook context, and you can sample it, select portions of it, overlay or lay out related items, and easily go back and forth between the raw data and its visual representation as you capture your emerging understanding of the features and relationships in the data. \n",

    "As you can see, you can specify Earth-based plots easily with GeoViews, and if your HoloViews objects are too big to visualize in Matplotlib or in a web browser directly, you can add `datashade()` to render them into images as needed.  With Bokeh, the data will be rendered dynamically on every zoom or pan, providing the experience of exploring your data even though the data is always pre-rendered to an image before providing it to the web browser.\n",

    "Often, a static image is an appropriate outcome from a visualization project, suitable for embedding in documents like this one and in presentations. However, in other cases the results from a project are better delivered as an application that lets users select and view the data of most interest to them. HoloViews provides widgets for such an app automatically, as you saw above, in the case of declared dimensions like those corresponding to a parameter sweep.  However, other fully custom controls are often needed in such apps, and the Param library lets you easily set up arbitrary custom controls that communicate between JavaScript and Python much as HoloViews and Bokeh do. Using these tools, you can easily add widgets to control filtering, selection, and other options interactively, either in a Jupyter notebook or in a standalone server:"
